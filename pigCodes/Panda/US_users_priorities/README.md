This code tries to answer the following question:
Do US ATLAS users have any advantage in getting their code to run thanks to "over the pledge" resources available at US ATLAS sites?

Results are in results/Panda/US_users_priorities :
1. NusersOfUSsites - numbers of jobs (grouped per users country of origin) that run in US cloud.
2. WaitTimesOfUsersOfUSsites - average wait times of jobs (grouped per users country of origin) that run in US cloud.
3. NusersOfNonUSsites - numbers of jobs (grouped per users country of origin) that run in non-US cloud.
4. WaitTimesOfUsersOfNonUSsites - average wait times of jobs (grouped per users country of origin) that run in non-US cloud.
5. nJobsPerCloudOrigin - numbers of jobs (grouped per user's origin and cloud of the execution site)
6. WaitTimePerCloudOrigin - average wait times of all the jobs (grouped per user's origin and cloud of the execution site)
